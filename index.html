				<p>
					Ada Lovelace (1815â€“1852), the daughter of poet Lord Byron, was an
					English mathematician and writer. She is best known for her work on
					Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the
					Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is now
					recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a
					machine, making Lovelace arguably the first computer programmer in
					history. Her foresight into the capabilities of computers extended
					beyond mere number crunching and foreshadowed future applications in
					music, art, and beyond.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ada's legacy as a visionary in science and technology continues to
					inspire generations. Every year, Ada Lovelace Day is celebrated to
					honor the achievements of women in STEM.
